# Melody Generator

## 🎵 Overview

This project generates personalized musical melodies based on a user’s birthday, using a bigram note-transition model trained from NES-style MIDI datasets as well as custom training melodies.
Melodies can be exported in three formats:
- text note sequences (.txt)
- MIDI files (.mid)
- audio waveform (.wav)
